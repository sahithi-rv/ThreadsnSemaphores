The inn size and total number of soldiers have to be given as input

Each soldier will be in the inn for atleast 1 sec.

There are 2 queues, 1 for yorks and other for lanchesters and there is an entry point into inn.

The queues will ensure that any soldier is not waiting unnecessarily.

And also if york1,york2,york3 are signalled at once to enter the inn, they can enter according to the scheduler,but they enter one after other consecutively.

Please ignore warnings that arise after compilation.
